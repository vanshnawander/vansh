          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>In this blog, we'll look at performance considerations in GPU programming, focusing on matrix multiplication as a case study. The reason to choose matrix multiplication is becuase firstly, it is easier to understand, secondly is one of the most parallelizable operation, also it has vast number of applications in graphics processing, deep learning (currently the major attention mechanism), and many more. <br>
          One more thing which matrix multiplication is highly sensitive to memory access patterns and thread organization. and so it becomes a very good example for learning performance optimization concepts espically in GPUs, other things to explore could be fourier transforms, convolution operations, and sorting algorithms.</p>
