          <h2>Introduction to Knowledge Distillation</h2>
          <p>Knowledge distillation is a machine learning technique where a smaller "student" model learns to mimic the behavior of a larger, more complex "teacher" model. This approach enables the deployment of efficient models while maintaining much of the performance of their larger counterparts.</p>
          <p>The concept, first introduced by Geoffrey Hinton and his colleagues, has become increasingly important in the era of large neural networks and LLMs, where computational efficiency and deployment constraints are critical considerations.</p>
